disclaimers:

There are different technologies on how to build your API being the most popular ones: 
Rest API, GraphQL, web sockets and gRPC. 

This will ultimately depend on the problem we want to solve, but in this example we are going to go for a Rest API. 

Weâ€™ll be building a minimal example of a Full Stack app, so we might not use all the best practices that are suggested.
